No this is not Randonicon 2, this mod is just it's v7 successor.

You can also check out the currently-archived version of this mod, more commonly known as Randonicon: https://github.com/stripey76/Randonicon

Randonicon is best played on the last version of v6 (build 126.2), but it can be run in v7 too with limitations.
This mod, now titled Clesia instead of just Randonicon, focuses primarily on adding a new planet, whereas before there was content for both serpulo and other planetary content, this will mean less content in general, BUT you can use clesia and randonicon simultaneously if you want the full experience.
**(Do note randonicon's clesia might cause confusion with the updated Clesia.)**
